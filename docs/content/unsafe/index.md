So far, we used the type-safe, generic API of Ark throughout.
However, there may be use cases where component types are not known at compile-time,
like serialization and de-serializations.
For these cases, Ark offers an unsafe, ID-based API.
It is accessible via {{< api ecs World.Unsafe >}}.

## Component IDs

Internally, each component type is mapped to an {{< api ecs ID >}}.
We don't see it in the generic API, but we can use it for more flexibility in the ID-based API.
IDs can be obtained by the function {{< api ecs ComponentID >}}.
If a component is not yet registered, it gets registered upon first use.

{{< code-func unsafe_test.go TestUnsafeIDs >}}

## Creating entities

Entities are created with {{< api ecs Unsafe.NewEntity >}}, giving the desired component IDs:

{{< code-func unsafe_test.go TestUnsafeNewEntity >}}

## Filters and queries

Filters and queries work similar to the generic API, but also component IDs instead of generics:

{{< code-func unsafe_test.go TestUnsafeQuery >}}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note the type casts! These are required because {{< api ecs Query.Get >}} returns an `unsafe.Pointer`
> to the underlying component storage.
> Extra care should be taken here, because this is a common source of bugs and the cast is not checked for the correct type.

## Component access

Components of entities can be accessed outside queries using {{< api ecs Unsafe.Get >}}/{{< api ecs Unsafe.Has >}}:

{{< code-func unsafe_test.go TestUnsafeGet >}}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Again, note the type cast! See above for details.

## Component operations

Components can be added and removed using methods of {{< api ecs Unsafe >}}:

{{< code-func unsafe_test.go TestUnsafeComponents >}}

## Limitations

Besides not being type-safe (i.e. you can cast to anything without an immediate error), the unsafe API has a few limitations:

- It is slower than the type-safe API.
- Newly added components can't be initialized directly.  
  {{< api ecs Unsafe.Get >}} must be used for initialization.
- There are currently no batch operations provided for the unsafe API.
