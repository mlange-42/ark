Ark is a work in progress Entity Component System in Go.

Ark implements the lessons learned from my other Go ECS: [Arche](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche).
The primary aims are:

- more feature-complete entity relationships
- making it even faster than Arche (already achieved)
- a more structured design due to better planning of features
- more focus on the generic API

At the moment, Ark is not in a usable state yet.
